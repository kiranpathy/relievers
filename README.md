This project will explore 2025 pitchers with an attempt to look at some potential candidates for conversion from relievers to starters. It will utilize a multiple linear regression with notable variables, which will be first run with starters data from 2025, then tested on current relievers from the 2025 season. From there, data will further be filtered to create ideal conditions for a starting pitcher, which will hopefully narrow down to a few candidates that could be interesting to look at.
